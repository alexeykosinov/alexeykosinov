Formerly radio engineer, located in Moscow, looking for an interesting job deeply connected with the embedded development & hardware design. Possesses skills, which required to perform complex tasks in the area of building digital control and acquisition systems for a remote sensing satellites. 
Have over 5+ experience to develop firmware for a Xilinx FPGA's and some MCU (early Atmel chips, STM32F4, STM32H7) and Texas Instruments TMS320 DSP. 

## Skills

### Embedded Skills
  - VHDL/C/C++ lower-speed interfaces such as I2C, SPI, 1-wire, UART - and various modification depends on the task
  - VHDL       high-speed SerDes transceivers: custom development, tunning, debugging
  - VHDL       fiber optics transceivers communication
  - VHDL/C/C++ connectivity between FPGA and DAC / ADC using LVDS-bus or JESD204 protocol
  - VHDL/C/C++ using system setting of FPGA to control internal resource susing ICAP (partial reconfiguration, multiboot, single event upset)
  - VHDL/C/C++ asynchronous communication with DSP (using EMIFA or similar interfaces)
  - VHDL/C/C++ strong simulation/debugging skills
  - VHDL       basic knowledge of OSVVM
  - C/C++      ethernet (LWIP, TCP/IP stack)
  - C/C++      USB communication (VCP, HID, FATFS)
  - C/C++      PCIe
  - C++        basic knowledge (and constantly improving) of object-oriented programming
  - C          Linux kernel drivers (currently working on a PCIe DMA driver)
  - tcl/bash   software testing, test automation. If it can be automate it will be!
  ...

#### Using Python:
  - as basic scripting language
  - create simple debug software
  - CLI interfaces (via click)
  - parsing stuff
  - json'ing

### Hardware Skills
  - design complex fault tolerant functionality and high performance into systems for space applications
  - pre-/post-topological analysis, delay analysis
  - strong lab skills, including use of common test and measurement equipment (oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, etc.) to debug complex electronic circuits
  - start-to-finish design skills with industry-standard CAD/EDA tools, including schematic entry, PCB layout, component definition, and CAD library management (Mentor Graphics Xpedition, have some experience with Altium Designer and Allegro PCB)
  - PCB analysis and verification tool: Mentor Graphics HyperLynx and Cedence Sigrity
